## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No account found" error
**Solution**: Ensure `DEV_MODE=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true` are set. Redeploy if on Vercel.

### Issue: Dev login button doesn't appear
**Solution**: Check browser console for `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE`. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R).

### Issue: Stripe error on billing
**Solution**: Add dummy Stripe keys to environment variables (even in dev mode).

### Issue: Data doesn't persist
**Solution**: Configure Vercel KV or accept in-memory storage for testing.

### Issue: 500 errors on API routes
**Solution**: Check server logs for `[DEV MODE]` messages. Ensure `AUTH_SECRET` is set.
