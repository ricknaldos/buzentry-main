# Monthly Subscription Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

Your app is fully configured for **monthly recurring subscriptions** with Stripe! Here's what's working:

1. ‚úÖ **Stripe Checkout** - Creates monthly subscriptions (not one-time payments)
2. ‚úÖ **Customer Portal** - Customers can manage their own subscriptions
3. ‚úÖ **Email-based Access** - Customers can access their subscription using just their email
4. ‚úÖ **Cancel Anytime** - Full self-service cancellation through Stripe
5. ‚úÖ **Test Keys** - Your test environment is ready

## üéØ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Create Monthly Subscription Product in Stripe

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard** (Test Mode):
   - Direct link: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
   - Or: Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí "+ Add product"

2. **Create Product**:
   ```
   Name: BuzEntry Monthly Subscription
   Description: Automatic apartment door entry service

   Pricing:
   - Model: Standard pricing
   - Price: $6.99 USD
   - Billing: Recurring ‚Üí Monthly ‚úì
   - Currency: USD
   ```

3. **Save** and **copy the Price ID** (looks like `price_test_abc123...`)

4. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID="price_test_YOUR_COPIED_ID_HERE"
   ```

5. **Restart your dev server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 2: Enable Stripe Customer Portal

This lets customers manage their subscriptions themselves (cancel, update payment, etc.)

3. **Configure Features**:

   **Allow customers to:**
   - ‚úÖ **Update payment method** (let them change their credit card)
   - ‚úÖ **Cancel subscription** (enable "Cancel immediately")
   - ‚úÖ **View invoices** (let them download receipts)
   - ‚úÖ **Pause subscription** (optional - nice feature!)

   **Cancellation settings:**
   - **Allow cancellation**: Yes, immediately
   - **Collect cancellation reason**: Yes (helps you understand churn)
   - **Save their data after cancellation**: Yes (so they can reactivate easily)

4. **Save** your settings

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

```

### Step 4: Test in Production

2. **Verify** it appears in Live Dashboard
3. **Test cancellation** through Customer Portal
4. **Cancel immediately** so you're not charged

## üìä Monitoring Subscriptions

### Key Metrics to Watch:

**Stripe Dashboard** (https://dashboard.stripe.com):
- **MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue) - on main dashboard
- **Active Subscriptions** - Billing ‚Üí Subscriptions
- **Churn Rate** - Customers who cancel
- **Failed Payments** - Billing ‚Üí Payment failures

### Handling Failed Payments:

Stripe **automatically retries** failed payments using "Smart Retries":
- Day 0: Immediate retry
- Day 3: First retry
- Day 5: Second retry
- Day 7: Final retry
- If all fail ‚Üí subscription is canceled

You can configure this at: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic

## üîî Optional: Webhooks (Advanced)

If you want to be notified of subscription events:

1. **Create webhook endpoint**: `/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. **Listen for events**:
   - `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription
   - `customer.subscription.deleted` - Canceled subscription
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful payment
   - `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payment
3. **Configure in Stripe**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks

## üéØ Key Differences: Subscription vs One-Time

Your app is configured as **subscription**, which means:

‚úÖ **Recurring billing** - Customer charged $6.99 every month automatically
‚úÖ **Customer Portal** - Self-service management
‚úÖ **Proration** - Automatic calculations if they upgrade/downgrade
‚úÖ **Failed payment handling** - Automatic retries
‚úÖ **Subscription lifecycle** - Active ‚Üí Past Due ‚Üí Canceled

vs. One-time payments which are single charges with no recurring billing.
