## 🚀 How It Works

### New User Signup Flow

```
1. User clicks "Get Started" → enters email
2. Stripe checkout → payment successful
3. Stripe webhook fires
4. App provisions SignalWire number (mock or real)
5. User account created in database
6. Phone number indexed for fast lookup
7. Welcome email sent with phone number
8. User can log in to dashboard
```

### Incoming Call Flow

```
1. Someone buzzes apartment
2. SignalWire receives call
3. SignalWire webhook → /api/signalwire/voice
4. App looks up user by phone number
5. App checks user settings:

   IF paused:
     → Reject call with message
     → Log as "paused"

   ELSE IF forwarding enabled:
     → Forward to user's phone numbers
     → Ring all numbers simultaneously
     → Log as "forwarded"

   ELSE:
     → Auto-answer call
     → Say "Opening door"
     → Send DTMF code (e.g., press 4)
     → Hang up
     → Log as "answered"

6. Call logged to database
7. User sees it in dashboard immediately
```

## 🎮 Current Mode: Mock SignalWire

**What works right now** (without SignalWire credentials):

✅ User signup → Gets mock number (+15551234567)
✅ Dashboard → All features functional
✅ Pause/Resume → State persists correctly
✅ Door code → Saves and retrieves
✅ Forwarding → Settings save properly
✅ Analytics → Mock data displays
✅ Email → Templates work (needs Resend API key)

**What needs SignalWire credentials**:

❌ Real phone number provisioning
❌ Actual incoming calls
❌ Real DTMF tones to unlock doors
❌ Real call forwarding

---

## 🔧 To Enable Real Phone Calls

Just add these 3 lines to `.env.local`:

```bash
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT_ID=abc123xyz
SIGNALWIRE_API_TOKEN=PTxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE_URL=yourcompany.signalwire.com
```

That's it! **No code changes needed.** The app automatically:
- ✅ Provisions real numbers on signup
- ✅ Handles real incoming calls
- ✅ Auto-answers with DTMF codes
- ✅ Forwards calls when enabled
- ✅ Logs everything

---

## 📋 Required Setup (Before Production)

### 1. SignalWire (for phone numbers)
- Sign up at [signalwire.com](https://signalwire.com)
- Get credentials (3 env vars)
- See `SIGNALWIRE_INTEGRATION.md` for details

### 2. Resend (for emails)
- Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Get API key
- Configure domain for support@buzentry.com

### 3. Vercel KV (database)
- Create KV store in Vercel dashboard
- Auto-added to project on deploy

### 4. Stripe (already set up)
- ✅ Webhook configured
- ✅ Product created
- Just needs production webhook URL

### 5. NextAuth
- Generate secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Add to env vars

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Without SignalWire (Current)

- [x] Sign up user → See mock number in dashboard
- [x] Set door code → Saves successfully
- [x] Toggle pause → State changes
- [x] Enable forwarding → Add multiple numbers
- [x] View analytics → See empty state

### With SignalWire (Production)

- [ ] Sign up user → Get real phone number
- [ ] Call the number → Auto-answers with DTMF
- [ ] Enable forwarding → Call rings your phone
- [ ] Pause service → Call is rejected
- [ ] View analytics → See real call data

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Per User Per Month

```
Your revenue:        $6.99/month
SignalWire costs:
  - Phone number:    $1.50
  - Calls (30/mo):   $0.04
Total profit:        ~$5.45/month (78% margin)
```

Very profitable! 🎉

## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### SignalWire Phone Provisioning

```typescript
// Automatic on signup - see app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
const phoneNumber = await provisionPhoneNumber(userId);

// Mock mode: Returns +15551234567
// Real mode: Purchases number from SignalWire
```

### Call Handling Logic

```typescript
// See app/api/signalwire/voice/route.ts

// 1. Look up user by phone number
const user = await findUserByPhoneNumber(to);

// 2. Check settings
if (user.isPaused) return rejectCall();
if (user.forwardingEnabled) return forwardCall();
return autoAnswerWithDTMF(user.doorCode);
```

### TwiML for Auto-Answer

```xml
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice">Opening door</Say>
  <Play digits="4w"/>
  <Pause length="2"/>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>
```

### TwiML for Forwarding

```xml
<Response>
  <Say voice="alice">Connecting your call</Say>
  <Dial timeout="30">
    <Number>+15551234567</Number>
    <Number>+15559876543</Number>
  </Dial>
  <Hangup/>
</Response>
```
