# BuzEntry - Suggested Improvements

## üéØ High Priority

### 1. **SMS Notifications**
Send SMS to user when:
- Someone calls their number
- Access denied (wrong code)
- Door unlocked successfully
- Passcode used/expired

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Use SignalWire SMS API
await client.messages.create({
  from: '+12818928899',
  to: user.forwardingNumbers[0],
  body: 'üö™ Door unlocked by guest passcode 7842'
});
```

**Files to modify**:
- `app/api/signalwire/voice/route.ts` - Add SMS after unlock
- Create `lib/notifications.ts` - Centralized notification system

---

### 2. **Call Recording (Optional)**
Record calls for security/audit purposes:
- Store recordings in S3/Vercel Blob
- Show in dashboard analytics
- Auto-delete after 30 days

**Implementation**:
```xml
<Response>
  <Say>Welcome</Say>
  <Record maxLength="30" recordingStatusCallback="/api/signalwire/recording"/>
  <!-- rest of TwiML -->
</Response>
```

---

### 3. **Multi-Language Support**
Allow users to choose greeting language:
- English (current)
- Spanish
- French
- etc.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In user profile
languagePreference: 'en' | 'es' | 'fr'

// In TwiML generation
const message = {
  en: 'Welcome. Please enter your code.',
  es: 'Bienvenido. Ingrese su c√≥digo.',
  fr: 'Bienvenue. Entrez votre code.'
}[user.languagePreference || 'en'];
```

---

### 4. **Dashboard Enhancements**

#### A. Real-time Call Notifications
Show toast when call comes in (WebSockets/SSE):
```typescript
// Create app/api/events/route.ts
export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const stream = new TransformStream();
  const writer = stream.writable.getWriter();

  // Send SSE events to dashboard
  return new Response(stream.readable, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    },
  });
}
```

#### B. Call History Filters
- Filter by date range
- Filter by status (answered/denied/missed)
- Search by phone number
- Export to CSV

#### C. Visual Analytics
Add charts using Recharts/Chart.js:
- Calls per day (line chart)
- Success rate pie chart
- Peak hours heatmap

---

### 5. **Security Enhancements**

#### A. Rate Limiting
Prevent brute force attacks:
```typescript
// Track failed attempts
const attempts = await kv.incr(`attempts:${from}:${to}`);
await kv.expire(`attempts:${from}:${to}`, 3600); // 1 hour

if (attempts > 3) {
  // Block for 1 hour
  return generateTwiML('Too many attempts. Try again in 1 hour.');
}
```

#### B. Whitelist/Blacklist
Allow users to:
- Whitelist specific numbers (auto-unlock)
- Blacklist spam numbers (auto-reject)

#### C. Two-Factor Authentication
Require 2FA for sensitive settings:
- Changing door code
- Disabling access code
- Adding new forwarding numbers

---

### 6. **Smart Features**

#### A. Schedule-Based Access
Allow different codes at different times:
```typescript
schedules: [{
  id: 'schedule_1',
  name: 'Cleaning Service',
  code: '5678',
  days: ['monday', 'wednesday'],
  startTime: '09:00',
  endTime: '12:00',
  active: true
}]
```

#### B. Location-Based Auto-Pause
Pause service when user is at home (use phone GPS):
```typescript
// Mobile app feature
if (userIsHome) {
  await updateUserProfile(userId, { isPaused: true });
}
```

#### C. Photo Capture
Take photo of visitor (if callbox has camera):
- Store in cloud storage
- Show in call history
- Send to user via SMS/email
